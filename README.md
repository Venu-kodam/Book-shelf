Step-by-Step Setup
Initialize a new React project using Vite:

1 ## Open your terminal and run the following command to create a new React project using Vite:

npx create-vite@latest my-react-app --template react
Replace my-react-app with your preferred project name.

2 ## Navigate into your project directory:

cd my-react-app

3 ## Install dependencies:

Inside your project directory, install the necessary dependencies:

npm install

This command installs all the dependencies.

4 ## Run the development server:

After the installation is complete, start the development server by running:
npm run dev

This command starts Vite's development server and opens your React application in the default web browser. The terminal output will provide the local development server URL (usually http://localhost:5173).

5 ## View your React application:

Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:5173 (or the URL provided in the terminal). You should see your React application running.
